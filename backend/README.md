## Background

Identifying and assessing athletic talent across India is a significant challenge. Many aspiring athletes, especially those from rural and remote areas, lack access to standardized assessment facilities and opportunities to showcase their abilities. The absence of reliable, scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from government support. While standard fitness assessment testsâ€”such as height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runsâ€”provide a scientific method to evaluate talent, their reach and implementation remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.

## Problem Statement

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) seeks an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:

- Allow athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in prescribed fitness assessment tests
- Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, measuring time/distance in runs)
- Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling
- Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks

## Key Features

- **AI-based Cheat Detection:** Identifies anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments
- **Offline Video Analysis:** Performs preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compares athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback
- **Gamified User Interface:** Uses progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation
- **Auto-Test Segmentation:** Automatically detects and segments performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort

## Expected Deliverables

- Mobile application (Android/iOS) for video recording and assessment of athlete performance across test batteries
- AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis, verification of test results, and cheat detection
- Secure backend system to transmit data to the Sports Authority of India for further processing
- Dashboard for officials to view and evaluate verified performance data

## Expected Impact

- Democratization of sports talent assessment, reaching even remote areas
- Low-cost, scalable solution enabling mass participation in talent identification initiatives
- Improved efficiency and transparency in evaluating and discovering potential athletes

## Pages
- Landing Page (showcasing app features and benefits)
- Login Page
- Signup Page
- Dashboard Page (not sure what to show here) [Probably a card-like display of activities that can be recorded, leaderboards or something]
- Profile Page (user information and overall activity history) [similar to that in GitHub]
- Submissions Page (user's all submitted videos and their statuses and calculated metrics)
- Submission Details Page (for each video uploaded, contains performance metrics history)
- Admin Page (for SAI officials to view and manage athlete submissions and data)
- Help Page (FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and contact information)

## UX Elements
- A rating system(similar to something on codeforces or leetcode)
- Providing user some comparison-based feedback (Like "you did better than 70% of users" or something)
- Badges assigned to user for something (but for what??)
- Graphs showing user's performance over time (line graph probably)

## Flow
1. Guest appears on the landing page
2. Guest clicks "Get Started" button
3. User is prompted to sign up or log in
4. After authentication, user is taken to the Dashboard
5. User will choose an activity amongst a list of them, and clicks upload video
6. User uploads the video from his device.
7.  Video will be sent to the backend.
8.  A video ID will be generated by the backend server (which will be saved in the local storage later, mapped with the preliminary results).
9.  On-app preliminary analysis will be performed by a lightweight ML model on TFLite/ONNX/something else.
10. Results will be stored in the Local storage, mapped to the corresponding video ID.
11. The video shall be saved into cache folder and shall be added to upload queue.
-- Internet Connection Required --
1. The video in local storage will be uploaded to cloudinary (with the video ID generated by the server).
2. The link of uploaded video from cloudinary will be sent to the python microservice for further processing(maybe the prelim metrics will also be sent).
3. The formulated results shall be sent back to the user as well as the online submission will be logged along with the result into the database.

# Hackathon Project Summary

## Project Flow

### 1. Frontend (React / React Native App)
- User opens app â†’ clicks camera.
- Pre-capture tips (lighting, framing, etc.).
- User records video â†’ trim or time-limit video on device (avoid dead seconds).
- Lightweight ML models run on-device for instant feedback (e.g., rep count, posture check).
- Show user prelim results immediately (no internet needed).
- Store both video + prelim metrics locally (if offline).

ðŸ‘‰ Use: React (web) or React Native (mobile).  
ðŸ‘‰ ML on-device: TensorFlow Lite (Android/iOS) or ONNX Runtime Mobile.

---

### 2. Backend (Node.js Server)
- Handles user authentication, video uploads, database ops, API gateway.
- Receives video + optionally prelim metrics.
- Passes video to Python FastAPI ML service for deeper analysis.
- Stores final metrics + feedback in DB.
- Sends results back to frontend (live or later if async).

ðŸ‘‰ Use: Express.js or NestJS for APIs.  
ðŸ‘‰ Upload storage: Cloudinary / AWS S3 / Firebase Storage.  
ðŸ‘‰ Database: MySQL/Postgres (via JawsDB or free tier cloud DB).

---

### 3. ML Service (FastAPI + Python)
- Heavy models deployed here (e.g., full pose estimation, advanced video analytics).
- Runs inside Uvicorn/Gunicorn server.
- Node.js calls this service via REST/HTTP.
- Processes video, merges with prelim metrics (optional), generates advanced results.

ðŸ‘‰ Use: FastAPI + PyTorch / TensorFlow.  
ðŸ‘‰ Run on server (free GPU if possible, else CPU with optimizations).

---

### 4. DevOps / Deployment
- **Frontend** â†’ Host for free (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
- **Backend (Node)** â†’ Free tier (Render, Railway, Heroku).
- **ML API (FastAPI)** â†’ Free/cheap cloud (Railway, Render, Hugging Face Spaces if model is supported).
- **Database** â†’ JawsDB / Supabase / Planetscale free tier.

Each part is deployed separately â†’ they talk via REST APIs.  
Yes, this is normal practice in hackathons & startups.

## What You Need to Focus On

1. **On-device (lightweight ML)**
   - Pick 1â€“2 simple models (e.g., rep counter, posture classifier).
   - Use TF Lite / ONNX Mobile.
   - Keep model size <10â€“20MB.

2. **Server-side (heavy ML)**
   - Deploy a bigger model (pose estimation, activity recognition).
   - Use FastAPI to expose endpoint.
   - Node.js will forward uploaded video â†’ FastAPI â†’ results â†’ back to user.

3. **Trimming & Compression**
   - Best option = set recording time limits (e.g., 1 min per activity).
   - Trim automatically at capture â†’ no dead seconds.
   - Compress video before upload (FFmpeg mobile libs or cloud service).

4. **User Experience**
   - Show instant feedback (prelim results) offline.
   - Upload video + get detailed feedback later when internet is back.
   - Store results in DB â†’ user can view past sessions.

---

## Tradeoffs (What we learned)
- **Light models**: small, fast, run on CPU, but less accurate.
- **Heavy models**: large, accurate, need GPU/server, slow.
- **Best approach**: use both â†’ lightweight on-device + heavyweight on server.
- **Low-end phones**: can still run lightweight models on CPU/GPU.
- **Trimming dead seconds with AI** is risky â†’ easier to just time-limit recording.

---

**Bottom line:**
- You will embed a lightweight model in the client app for offline analysis + instant feedback.
- You will deploy a Node.js backend + FastAPI ML service for full analysis and data storage.
- Youâ€™ll limit recording length instead of fancy dead-second removal.
